## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **1. Enhanced Classification Logic**
```python
# Improved classification rules for better accuracy
CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. ONLY classify as "finance" if there is an ACTUAL financial transaction
2. Food delivery emails (Swiggy, Zomato) with order confirmations = "finance"
3. Shopping emails with order confirmations = "finance"
4. Subscription emails with payment confirmations = "finance"
5. Transport services with payment receipts = "finance"
6. Utility bills with amounts = "finance"
7. Bank statements, UPI confirmations = "finance"
```

### **2. Financial Data Validation**
```python
def _is_valid_financial_data(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Check if financial data has meaningful information."""
    # Must have at least 2 meaningful fields
    key_fields = [
        "amount", "merchant_canonical", "merchant_name", 
        "transaction_type", "payment_method", "transaction_reference",
        "invoice_number", "order_id", "receipt_number"
    ]
    
    meaningful_fields = 0
    for field in key_fields:
        value = self._safe_get(data, field)
        if value and value != "" and value != 0:
            meaningful_fields += 1
    
    return meaningful_fields >= 2
```

### **3. Batch Processing Architecture**
```python
# Process emails in batches with concurrency control
batch_size = 75  # Optimal batch size for LLM efficiency
max_concurrent_batches = 3  # Balance between speed and API limits

# Use semaphore to limit concurrent batches
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_batches)

async def process_batch_with_semaphore(batch_idx, batch):
    async with semaphore:
        return await self._process_single_batch(batch_idx, batch, user_id)
```
