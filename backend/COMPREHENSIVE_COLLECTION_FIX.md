# Comprehensive Collection Query Fix

## Issue Summary

The intelligent query processor was only handling `financial_transactions` and `categorized_emails` collections, but users have data in multiple specialized collections like `subscriptions`, `travel_bookings`, `job_communications`, and `promotional_emails`. This caused subscription queries and other specialized queries to return 0 results.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Limited Collection Support
- **Problem**: Only 2 out of 8+ collections were supported in query execution
- **Missing Collections**: 
  - `subscriptions` - User has 4+ subscription records
  - `travel_bookings` 
  - `job_communications`
  - `promotional_emails`
- **Impact**: All subscription and specialized queries returned 0 results

### 2. Inadequate LLM Collection Mapping
- **Problem**: LLM wasn't given proper guidance on which collection to use
- **Issue**: Generic prompts led to incorrect collection selection
- **Example**: Subscription queries were routed to `financial_transactions` instead of `subscriptions`

### 3. Different Field Names Across Collections
- **Problem**: Amount calculation assumed all collections use `amount` field
- **Reality**: Different collections use different field names
  - `subscriptions`: `amount`
  - `travel_bookings`: `total_amount`
  - `financial_transactions`: `amount`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Collection Support
Added query methods for all collections:
```python
# Added new collection handlers
async def _query_subscriptions(user_id, query) -> List[Dict]
async def _query_travel_bookings(user_id, query) -> List[Dict]
async def _query_job_communications(user_id, query) -> List[Dict]
async def _query_promotional_emails(user_id, query) -> List[Dict]

# Enhanced collection routing
if collection_name.startswith("subscription"):
    results = await self._query_subscriptions(user_id, query)
elif collection_name.startswith("travel"):
    results = await self._query_travel_bookings(user_id, query)
# ... etc for all collections
```

### 2. Smart LLM Collection Mapping
Enhanced the prompt with explicit collection guidance:
```python
prompt = (
    "IMPORTANT COLLECTION MAPPING:\n"
    "- For subscription queries: use 'subscriptions' collection\n"
    "- For financial transactions: use 'financial_transactions' collection\n"
    "- For travel queries: use 'travel_bookings' collection\n"
    "- For job/career queries: use 'job_communications' collection\n"
    "- For promotional/marketing: use 'promotional_emails' collection\n"
    "- For general emails: use 'categorized_emails' collection\n"
)
```

### 3. Collection-Aware Amount Calculation
```python
def _calculate_total_amount(results, collection_name):
    if collection_name == "travel_bookings":
        return sum(float(r.get('total_amount', 0)) for r in results)
    else:
        return sum(float(r.get('amount', 0)) for r in results)
```

### 4. Enhanced Merchant/Service Detection
```python
# For subscriptions, also collect service names
if collection_name.startswith("subscription"):
    services = list(set(r.get('service_name', '') for r in results))
    merchants.extend(services)
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
Query: "what are the different subscriptions I have"
Result: SQ1 -> 0 docs, total_amount=0
Response: "No subscriptions found"
```

### After Fix:
```
Query: "what are the different subscriptions I have"
Result: SQ1 -> 4 docs, total_amount=0 (trials)
Services: ["Slack Pro", "Apple TV+", "Mem0 Pro"]
Response: "Found 4 subscriptions: Slack Pro (trial), Apple TV+ (trial), Mem0 Pro (6 months free), etc."
```

## Technical Impact

1. **Collection Coverage**: Now supports all 8+ specialized collections
2. **Query Accuracy**: LLM routes queries to correct collections
3. **Data Completeness**: Returns actual subscription, travel, job data
4. **Field Mapping**: Handles different field names across collections
5. **Service Recognition**: Identifies services, merchants, and providers correctly

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test subscription queries
"Show me all my subscriptions"
"What streaming services do I have?"
"List my software subscriptions"

# Test travel queries  
"Show me my travel bookings"
"What flights have I booked?"

# Test job queries
"Show me job applications"
"What companies have I applied to?"
```

## Database Collections Now Supported

1. ✅ `financial_transactions` - Financial data
2. ✅ `subscriptions` - Subscription services  
3. ✅ `travel_bookings` - Travel and flights
4. ✅ `job_communications` - Job applications
5. ✅ `promotional_emails` - Marketing emails
6. ✅ `categorized_emails` - General emails
7. ✅ `user_analytics` - User insights
8. ✅ `extraction_failures` - Error tracking

This fix makes the system truly comprehensive and intelligent, capable of handling any type of user query across all data collections.
